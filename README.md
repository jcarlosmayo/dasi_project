Religiosity and views towards homosexuality
===========================================

This correlation study was carried out for the course [Data Analysis and Statistical Inference](https://www.coursera.org/course/statistics)
offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). I used data from the [European Social Survey](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) to test the relationship
between the variables:

- Religiosity, as the response to the statement "how religious are you", on a scale from 0, not religious at all, to 10, very religious.

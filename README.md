Religiosity and views towards homosexuality
===========================================

This correlation study was carried out for the course [Data Analysis and Statistical Inference](https://www.coursera.org/course/statistics) offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). I used data from the [European Social Survey](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) to test the relationship between the variables:

- Religiosity, as the response to the statement "how religious are you", on a scale from 0, not religious at all, to 10, very religious.
- Views towards homosexuals, as the response to the statement "gays and lesbians free to live life as they wish", from 1, strongly agree, to 5, strongly disagree.

The result of a chi-square test of independence returns a p-value of 2.2e-16 using a significance level of 1%. There is a correlation between religiosity and views towards homosexuals. Homosexual tolerance seems to increase as religiosity decreases, and viceversa.
